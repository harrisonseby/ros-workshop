# Development notes
## Docker file
---
## diff_bot_sim
### Initial setup
1. First setup was to have a simple urdf, bring it up in rviz. Two trolley wheels and one castor wheel.
2. Need robot_state_publisher to publish the /robot_description. Rviz wont visualize movable joints with just robot state publisher. We need something that publishes the joint states as well.
3. This is acheived by starting the joint_state_publisher node. You do need the joint_state_publisher_gui to control the joints and see them reflecting in rviz.
4. Finally I added a rviz node to have it start from a certain saved panel state.
